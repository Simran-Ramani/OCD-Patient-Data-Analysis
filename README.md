# OCD-Patient-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes a clinical dataset of patients diagnosed with Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The goal is to understand patient demographics, comorbidities, symptom, patterns, and treatment outcomes using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for interactive visualization.

The dataset includes demographic details (age, gender, ethnicity, education), clinical features (obsession & compulsion types, Y-BOCS severity scores, comorbidities), and 

treatment information (previous diagnoses, medications).

# Tools & Technologies

SQL Server → for querying and exploring the dataset

Power BI Desktop → for creating interactive dashboards

GitHub → for project documentation and version control

## Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized patient records with the following key attributes:

Patient ID

Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education)

OCD clinical features (diagnosis duration, obsession & compulsion types)

Y-BOCS scores (obsessions, compulsions, total)

Comorbidities (Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, MDD, Panic Disorder)

Medications (SSRI, SNRI, Benzodiazepine, None)


# SQL Analysis

Exploratory queries were written to summarize key aspects of the dataset.

# Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize the insights from SQL queries:

Demographics

 - Patient distribution by gender, ethnicity, and age

Clinical Features

 - Most common obsessions and compulsions

 - Depression and anxiety prevalence

Treatment

 - Y-BOCS severity scores by medication type

 - Previous diagnoses breakdown

Comorbidities

 - Depression vs Anxiety distribution

# Key Insights

-Patient distribution is nearly balanced by gender.

-Harm-related and contamination obsessions are the most frequent.

-A significant proportion of patients also present with depression and anxiety.

-Average Y-BOCS scores vary slightly depending on medication type, indicating differences in treatment response.
